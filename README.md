# Word Riddle



A Wordle clone written in C# as a WPF application. This was the final project for my college class ".NET Programming". I used an Oracle database to have a leaderboard.
This was also my first time making an API and figuring out how to set up a database connected to the API and where to host in in the real-world.
This project also exercised my logical thinking figuring out how to make the core Wordle game to work just like the original.

# Verse App

This is my ongoing project (estimated completion by Summer 2026). It is a mobile-first Bible verse memorization app with a social aspect. Users can create, save, and organize collections of Bible verses or Bible reading plans. Users can search for verses by reference or keyword(s). Anywhere in the app a verse appears, metadata is shown such as how many other users have this verse, and how many have memorized this verse. Users can publish their collection or reading plan to a community page where other users can save it to their account. The app tracks your active Bible reading plan through its built-in Bible page, or if you prefer the physical Bible, you can check off progress manually. There is a main search feature where users can quick search for a reference, public collections, reading plans, or other users. Users can add friends and see friends' profiles, verses, stats, etc. There is a central notification system that notifies you of your freind's activity or of trending content in the public community page.
Made as a Blazor WebAssembly App.

Early on in my college career I decided to learn about web development since I wouldn't learn that at college. I learned HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
I used what I learned in my class "Data Structures & Algorithms" to make the search feature for the site in JavaScript.
The site was written in plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
