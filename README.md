A Wordle clone written in C# and XAML as a Avalonia application (for cross-platform). This was the final project for my college class ".NET Programming". I used an Oracle database to have a leaderboard.
This was also my first time making an API and figuring out how to set up a database connected to the API and where to host in in the real-world.
This project also exercised my logical thinking figuring out how to make the core Wordle game to work just like the original.

This is my ongoing project (estimated completion by Summer 2026). It is a mobile-first Bible verse memorization app with a social aspect. Users can create, save, and organize collections of Bible verses or Bible reading plans. Users can search for verses by reference or keyword(s). Anywhere in the app a verse appears, metadata is shown such as how many other users have this verse, and how many have memorized this verse. Users can publish their collection or reading plan to a community page where other users can save it to their account. The app tracks your active Bible reading plan through its built-in Bible page, or if you prefer the physical Bible, you can check off progress manually. There is a main search feature where users can quick search for a reference, public collections, reading plans, or other users. Users can add friends and see friends' profiles, verses, stats, etc. There is a central notification system that notifies you of your freind's activity or of trending content in the public community page.
Made as a Blazor WebAssembly App.

Early on in my college career I decided to learn about web development since I wouldn't learn that at college. I learned HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
I used what I learned in my class "Data Structures & Algorithms" to make the search feature for the site in JavaScript.
The site was written in plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
